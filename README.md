# Python - Restaurant Management System

This program will allow users to manage orders for a typical fast food restaurant using the Tkinter, random and time Python packages. Users will be able to enter the quantity of each item that is being ordered and when the Total button is clicked the program calculates the total value of the order.

There is also a Price button that is available to allow users to view the menu items and their respective prices. The Reset button will clear all existing entries and the Exit button will terminate the program's session.
